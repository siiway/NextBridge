features:
  - title: Multi-platform
    details: Supports QQ (via NapCat), Discord, Telegram, Feishu/Lark, and DingTalk out of the box. New platforms can be added as drivers.
  - title: Config-driven routing
    details: Define which channels talk to each other using a simple JSON rules file — no code needed. Use "connect" rules to link groups, or "forward" rules for fine-grained control.
  - title: Media bridging
    details: Images, videos, voice messages, and files are automatically downloaded and re-uploaded to the target platform. Configurable per-instance size limits.
  - title: Per-channel message formatting
    details: Customize the message format for each target platform independently. Discord webhooks get native username and avatar; QQ and Telegram get clean text prefixes.
